      <p>
        I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience in web development. My primary skills are in TypeScript
        and JavaScript with React ecosystem, but I also have experience in the backend with Node.js and testing
        frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm well-versed in Docker and Linux commands and am comfortable working in a variety of development
        environments. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors and staying active. Hiking, soccer, and Formula 1
        racing are some of my favorite hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me. If you have any questions or would like to chat further,
        feel free to reach out!
      </p>
